# MeyuFlix â€“ Self-Hosted Media Stack on K3s

This repository contains the declarative configuration for my **self-hosted home media environment**, deployed on a single-node [**K3s**](https://k3s.io/) Kubernetes cluster running on Ubuntu 24.04 Server.

Each application is managed using **Helm** and defined by a version-controlled `values.yaml` file under `apps/`. This setup enables reproducible, secure deployments â€” all isolated to my LAN.

## Current Status

This is a work in progress.
My current non-kubernetes setup work.
Some services are not yet migrated to this environment, and their files are not here, unless work has already begun on the transfer.
This is a hobby, and I am not experienced in K8s, so do not take anything you see here as guides or best practeces.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

> You can apply each app independently using Helm and the `app-template` chart:

```bash
helm repo add bjw-s https://bjw-s.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update

helm upgrade --install bazarr bjw-s/app-template \
  --namespace media --create-namespace \
  -f apps/bazarr/values.yaml
```

> Or orchestrate the whole stack using [Helmfile](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile) (to be implemented in the future).

## ðŸ”’ Security & Scope

This cluster is **not publicly exposed**. All ingress routes and services are locked to my local LAN and protected by firewall and DNS-level controls. K3s is configured with strict default permissions and token-based authentication.
